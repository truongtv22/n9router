# Changelog

## v0.4.59 (2026-09-11)

### Features & Improvements
- **Custom Models Capability Persistence**: Fixed `addCustomModel()` in `src/lib/localDb.js` to persist capability flags (`caps`) in DB and allow updating existing custom models, ensuring manual toggles (like Vision and Reasoning) are preserved.
- **DeepSeek V4.1 Vision Support**: Added native pattern matching for `deepseek-v4.1` with multimodal vision and reasoning capabilities in `open-sse/providers/capabilities.js`.
- **Dynamic Model Catalog Sync Across Webpack Bundles**: Stored `catalogSource` on `globalThis.__9r_catalogSource` so that Next.js API route handlers (`/api/models`, `/v1/models`) share the dynamically synced `models.dev` catalog with `instrumentation.js`.
- **AgentKit Integration**: Added AgentKit promo component to sidebar and updated documentation.

## v0.4.58 (2026-09-05)

### Upstream merge
- **9router v0.5.65**: Merged latest upstream capabilities, model catalog refresh, and protocol improvements.
- **Web Search & Fetch**: Added Ollama Cloud remote web fetch (`/v1/fetch`), Google Search grounded via Antigravity OAuth (`/v1/search`), native Xquik X/Twitter search provider with cursor pagination, and credential fallback for Ollama/ZAI/GLM search.
- **Dynamic Model Catalog**: Integrated daily background sync of model capabilities, modalities, and context limits from `models.dev` (with ETag/mtime caching and `MODEL_CATALOG_SYNC=off` toggle). Added custom model capability switches for vision/reasoning with live refresh. Converted `/v1/models/[kind]` to catch-all `/v1/models/[...model]` for single-model inspection with provider-prefixed IDs.
- **Catalog Refreshes**: Added Claude Fable 5.1 with adaptive thinking (`output_config.effort`) and updated Claude Code fingerprint (2.1.258); GLM-5.3 & GLM-5.3-Flash with 1M context, vision/multimodal, and reasoning effort; DeepSeek V4 Vision and Grok 4.5/4.6 (500k context); CodeBuddy-CN preview models; streamlined TokenRouter seed models; added provider icons for alims-intl, alitp-intl, fish-audio, selfhosted-*, and xquik.
- **Antigravity Quota Routing**: Added 429 strike-breaker circuit breaker (blocks connection/model in RAM for 15m after 3 strikes within 60s, clears on success); reset-aware fallback returning earliest upstream `resetAt` when exhausted; automatic `-WxH` aspect-ratio suffix mapping for image models; and competitive branding prompt sanitization (stripping Zed Claude prompt and rewriting OpenCode references). Bumped default Antigravity IDE version to 2.11.0 with dual-signature override support.
- **CLI Tools & Dashboard**: Added Bulk Grok CLI account batch import modal; centralized unified CLI endpoint and API key presets across all tool cards; provider status filter (`All`, `Active`, `Inactive`, `No connection`); connection list scrollable UX; and flash-of-unstyled-theme fix on first paint.
- **Quota Tracking & Observability**: Added Groq rate-limit headers tracking (`x-ratelimit-*`), Zed plan quotas (edit predictions, hosted requests, billing cycle reset), GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark quota windows (`spark_session` and `spark_weekly`), GLM multi-interval quotas (`CREDIT_LIMIT` and 5h/7d intervals), and captured `cached_tokens` on non-streaming OpenAI Responses/Codex requests.
- **Security & Protocols**: SSRF guard hardening against alternate IPv6 encodings, trailing dots, and DNS rebinding; protected `/responses` in dashboard guard; stripped Claude Code `[1m]` context markers; dropped foreign `server_tool_use` IDs; prevented caching on `defer_loading` tools; tool name decloaking in same-format streaming; CommandCode in-stream error frame translation; Kiro MITM AWS EventStream binary and inline image forwarding; and consolidated stream disconnect handling.

### n9router preservation
- **State DB**: Preserved lowdb (`db.json`) storage with atomic writes and corruption recovery, rejecting upstream SQLite migration.
- **Runtime**: Retained native `node:sqlite` for usage limiting and CLI hooks, rejecting `better-sqlite3` and `sql.js`.
- **Fork capabilities**: Preserved Antigravity Token Swap with 503 backoff retries, account health monitor (`healthStore.js`), Gemini 3.8 Flash tiered models (`gemini-3.8-flash-high|medium|low`), stream watchdog, Cursor BYOK catalog, ApiKeyUsageReport, UsageFlexReport, and EndpointPresetControl.

## v0.4.57 (2026-09-04)

### Improvements
- **SQLite Engine (`node:sqlite`)**: Replaced third-party `better-sqlite3` native C++ dependency with Node.js built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`). Eliminates `node-gyp` compilation requirements, C++ build tools (`python3`, `make`, `g++`, `linux-headers`) in Docker, and over 400 lines of brittle prebuild-install and runtime self-healing hooks.
- **Cursor Auto-Import**: Migrated local Cursor SQLite database (`state.vscdb`) token extraction to `node:sqlite` in read-only mode (`{ readOnly: true }`).
- **Dependencies & Build**: Removed `better-sqlite3` from dependencies and Next.js external packages, added Node engine requirement `>=22.13.0`, and cleaned up standalone build and publish scripts.

## v0.4.56 (2026-09-04)

### Features
- **Antigravity Gemini 3.8 Flash**: Added `gemini-3.8-flash-high|medium|low`, Gemini direct API `gemini-3.8-flash`, MITM proxy extraction/synonyms, quota tracking, and capabilities.

### Fixes
- **Antigravity MITM (Windows)**: Added platform capability flags (`isWin`, `needsSudoPassword: !isWin`) to the Antigravity MITM status endpoint to avoid triggering sudo password prompts on Windows hosts.
- **CommandCode vision (#7)**: Preserved image inputs for vision-capable CommandCode models by correcting capability detection, translating OpenAI/Claude image blocks to the upstream AI SDK format, and prefetching remote images as base64 before dispatch.

## v0.4.55 (2026-08-27)

### Improvements
- **MITM status feedback**: Improved error reporting and diagnostics on the CLI tools dashboard card (`MitmServerCard`), gracefully surfacing HTTP 401/403 auth hints and network error details when connecting to the Antigravity MITM status endpoint.

## v0.4.54 (2026-08-25)

### Upstream merge
- **9router v0.5.55**: Adopted refreshed provider catalog, authentication, translation, streaming, and CLI packaging improvements.
- **SAML 2.0 SSO**: Added native SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On integration, IdP metadata XML & certificate uploaders, SSO protocol switcher, dynamic SAML sign-in button, and SAML user badges.
- **Providers and models**: Added Alibaba Token Plan (`token-plan.ap-southeast-1`), Kimchi dual auth (OAuth + API key), Fish Audio text-to-speech provider, `glm-5.3` for GLM Coding and GLM (China) registries, Opencode-Go transport format routing with per-model guards, and `llm7` test support.
- **Routing and translation**: Added Kiro multi-surface auth-aware endpoint routing, integrity-gate streaming, header-based interception (`x-amz-target`), `auto` model slot, and accurate output token accounting. Added early billing error detection in Qoder SSE for failover. Fixed OpenAI Responses empty `tool_calls` array premature termination (#3234) and preserved `prompt_cache_key` when converting chat to responses (#3216).
- **Quota and client handling**: Strip competitive system prompts in Antigravity to prevent 429 quota errors from Zed IDE. Forward official client headers for free-tier Opencode requests. Added 120s TTL caching and promise dedup for Claude quota calls with `?force=1` bypass for manual refresh. Re-anchored Claude passthrough cache breakpoints with 1h TTL.
- **Combos and adapters**: Vision adapter image detection from Hermes and attachment payloads; stripped `stream_options` from Fusion panel fan-out; added `api_key` parameter in Hermes YAML config.
- **Documentation and i18n**: Added Spanish (`README.es.md`), French (`README.fr.md`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`README.pt-BR.md`) documentation translations.

### Security
- **Socket peer validation**: Require proof that `x-9r-real-ip` originates from trusted local socket connections (GHSA-pjm4-8fpg-f9p6).
- **SSRF guard**: Validate and reject non-public base URLs on web/search endpoints.
- **Authentication**: Block fresh-install remote login using default password (returns 403 without issuing JWT).
- **Privacy**: Redacted sensitive payload contents on `/api/usage/request-details`.

### n9router preservation
- **State DB**: Retained lowdb (`db.json`) as the sole state persistence layer, rejecting upstream SQLite migration.
- **Fork capabilities**: Preserved MITM token pool swapping, retry classification, token cooldowns, stream watchdog controls, API-key limits, token-swap usage observer, Antigravity account-type badges, cached-token tracking, ApiKeyUsageReport, UsageFlexReport, Cursor BYOK installer, and fork branding.

## v0.4.53 (2026-08-15)

### Features
- **Antigravity Gemini 3.7 Flash**: Added `ag/gemini-3.7-flash-high|medium|low`, Gemini API `gemini-3.7-flash`, MITM aliases/slots, pricing, and capabilities.

### Fixes
- **Quota Tracker**: Antigravity now fingerprints as IDE **2.5.5**, the first client version whose `fetchAvailableModels` response includes Gemini 3.7 Flash quotas.
- **Quota parsing**: Keep the live `gemini-3.7-flash-tiered` bucket as a fallback when Google has not split high/medium/low keys.

## v0.4.52 (2026-08-08)

### Fixes
- **Cursor BYOK**: Restored the dashboard installer card and updated the installer to resolve the latest upstream `main` commit before downloading its immutable source tarball.
- **macOS Cursor BYOK**: Avoid unnecessary sudo when Cursor’s atomic-write targets are user-writable, preventing the `EPERM` install failure.

## v0.4.51 (2026-08-07)

### Upstream merge
- **9router v0.5.50**: Adopted refreshed provider, quota, pricing, OAuth, usage, dashboard, media-provider, and CLI packaging improvements.
- **Routing and translation**: Added Kiro direct Claude routing, conversation/session continuity improvements, native reasoning mapping, custom-tool Responses handling, cache-inclusive token accounting, and stronger terminal-stream handling.
- **Providers**: Added or expanded Devin CLI, Trae, Windsurf, Zed, CodeBuddy International, TokenRouter, and self-hosted embedding/STT/TTS support.

### Fixes
- **Vision Adapter**: Removing the last model now actually clears the pool and disables that adapter; enabling it again explicitly restores its default fallback model.
- **Antigravity project IDs**: Stopped proactive OAuth-refresh onboarding retries. Existing project IDs remain intact; lookup still occurs only for an explicit import/onboarding flow or a request-time cold miss.
- **Merge compatibility**: Restored Kiro session/continuation helpers and the Kiro thinking-field guard; updated background token refresh and usage-provider lookup to use n9router's lowdb persistence.

### n9router preservation
- Retained lowdb (`db.json`) as the sole state store, including MITM token swapping/retry/cooldowns, stream watchdog and `[DONE]` handling, API-key limits, usage reports, Cursor BYOK, selective import, and fork branding.

### Validation
- Added capacity-adapter model-control regression coverage; the focused test suite and production build pass.

## v0.4.50 (2026-07-18)

### Features
- **XAI Grok Imagine video**: Added OpenAI-compatible `/v1/videos/*` proxy routes, account-aware generation/polling, and the `n9router xai video` CLI command.
- **Grok Build**: Added dashboard setup/status integration, live model discovery, subscription-aware billing and quota reporting, token-expiry propagation, and current protocol support.
- **Usage and providers**: Added per-provider quota visibility controls, safer bulk API-key additions, expanded `/v1/models` capability handling, Kiro GPT-5.6 slots, and Alibaba International endpoint compatibility.
- **Token saver control**: Added a per-request bypass header for token-saver features.

### n9router merge policy
- **Preserved fork behavior**: Retained lowdb/db.json persistence, Cursor BYOK, token-pool and stream-watchdog safeguards, usage reporting, and n9router branding.
- **Excluded translation updates**: Did not adopt upstream locale updates or request-format/Kiro session-replay translator changes.

### Tests
- Added upstream coverage for XAI video, Grok Build, quota visibility, bulk API-key naming, provider updates, and Grok CLI usage.

## v0.4.49 (2026-07-11)

### Features
- **New providers**: Added Grok CLI OAuth/device-code routing, Featherless presets, Perplexity Agent API, configurable SearXNG, and updated provider/model catalogs.
- **PXPipe token saver**: Added multimodal prompt compression with dashboard controls and lifecycle, status, log, and statistics APIs.
- **Headroom**: Added extras detection, installation, restart, and app-proxied dashboard support.
- **Routing and translation**: Added per-model thinking levels, stronger OpenAI Responses multi-turn conversion, structured Anthropic token counting, and RTK git-log/Windows parsing.
- **Dashboard and i18n**: Added Farsi, expanded Chinese translations, cached-token display, and provider-model UI refinements.

### Improvements
- **Reliability**: Improved Codex fast-tier/capacity handling, provider refresh and usage tracking, Antigravity IDE fingerprinting/usage headers, and request-detail handling.
- **Coverage**: Added regression tests for Grok CLI, PXPipe, token counting, thinking levels, request details, and translator edge cases.

### n9router preservation
- **Persistence**: Rejected the upstream SQLite migration; n9router continues to use lowdb at `~/.n9router/db.json`.
- **MITM and streaming**: Retained token-swap cooldown/retry behavior, watchdog controls, terminal `[DONE]` handling, and raw-source MITM runtime packaging.
- **Fork capabilities**: Retained Cursor BYOK, selective database import, usage reporting, API-key limits, MoMo donations, and n9router branding.

## v0.4.48 (2026-07-06)

### Fixes
- **MITM lock contention**: Reverted the `.mitm.lock` file introduced by the security-audit patch. A crash or kill during startup could leave a stale lock that permanently blocked both auto-start and manual Start with "MITM server is already starting (lock contention)". Startup now guards on the in-process handle and PID file, as it did before.

## v0.4.47 (2026-07-05)

### Features
- **Cursor BYOK installer**: Added a guided CLI installer for bringing your own API key to Cursor, with step-by-step process cards, step indicators, and a quick-guide reference section.
- **Cursor BYOK Windows support**: Implemented the full BYOK workflow on Windows including UAC elevation handling and restore-state management.
- **Cursor BYOK macOS hardening**: Implemented secure macOS code-signature validation for the BYOK workflow and improved restore-state management.

### Improvements
- **Dashboard navigation**: Added a MITM proxy navigation link to the dashboard sidebar for easier access to proxy settings.
- **Endpoint page**: Updated the endpoint page UI.


## v0.4.46 (2026-07-04)

### Fixes
- **ClinePass connection tests**: Added ClinePass OAuth/API-key validation support so dashboard provider tests no longer report unsupported or invalid credentials when real requests work.
- **ClinePass model tests**: Normalized successful ClinePass `data.choices` response envelopes into standard OpenAI `choices`, fixing false “Provider returned no completion choices” errors in the model test UI.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for ClinePass provider validation and non-streaming response-envelope normalization.

## v0.4.45 (2026-07-04)

### Features
- **Provider registry**: adopted the unified `open-sse/providers/registry/*` model/capability/pricing/auth registry and moved pricing resolution to `open-sse/providers/pricing.js`.
- **New and expanded providers**: added or updated ClinePass, Kimchi, CodeBuddy CN, MiMo Free, Venice AI, Vercel AI Gateway, Blackbox, and NVIDIA provider support.
- **Media providers**: added image generation, TTS, STT, media-provider dashboard pages, and `/v1/audio/*`, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/search`, and `/v1/web/fetch` route support.
- **Headroom and token saver**: added Headroom lifecycle APIs/dashboard support, Docker sidecar support, token-saver dashboard, and safer Responses compression handling.
- **Ponytail**: added the minimalist code-generation RTK feature.
- **Combo routing**: added Fusion strategy, per-combo strategy selection, capacity auto-switching, and improved custom-provider model visibility.
- **Codex**: added bulk account import, reset-credit expiry details, opt-in quota auto-ping, better Responses terminal handling, custom-tool preservation, and reasoning-effort preservation.
- **Kiro**: added headless API-key auth, direct Claude↔Kiro routing, external IdP/Microsoft SSO import, IDC token import, multi-endpoint failover, Claude Sonnet 5 support, and regional IdC routing.
- **Usage and quota**: added cached-token tracking, corrected input/output/cache cost calculation, deduped streaming request-detail logs, and reduced streaming usage double-counting.
- **Security and hardening**: adopted SSRF protections, DB export/import re-auth, remote default-password guard, real client-IP rate limiting, and Kiro region validation.
- **CLI and packaging**: adopted Next.js 16 nested standalone output handling, Docker Compose support, Windows tray DPI improvements, and JSONC-tolerant CLI settings routes.

### Fixes
- Fixed n9router-compatible provider creation after the upstream registry merge by restoring the missing `AI_PROVIDERS` import in `/api/providers`.
- Kept fork Antigravity usage/tier quota behavior, configurable Kiro/Antigravity retry behavior, stream `[DONE]` sentinel behavior, and pricing import compatibility after the upstream pricing move.

## v0.4.44 (2026-07-04)

### Features

- **Selective database import**: Added granular import controls for merging or replacing supported settings and provider data.
- **Upstream v0.4.71 providers and models**: Added Xiaomi MiMo V2.5 Pro routing, Qoder latest-model discovery/import, and MiniMax-M3 model, pricing, and quota support.
- **Caveman and localization**: Added Wenyan classical-Chinese Caveman levels, locale-based visibility, translated endpoint exposure notices, and a Russian README.

### Improvements

- **Release pipeline**: Added native AMD64/ARM64 Docker builds, digest-based manifest publishing, optional npm publishing, and manual release-tag support.
- **Offline builds**: Self-hosted the Inter font to remove the Google Fonts dependency from Docker and CI builds.
- **Dashboard and test coverage**: Reorganized language/menu/profile actions and expanded translator, provider, and real-provider smoke-test coverage.

### Fixes

- **Codex reliability**: Hardened streaming timeouts and terminal events, preventing hanging clients, and improved OAuth token refresh durability.
- **Kiro and Claude compatibility**: Fixed Kiro binary EventStream handling, tool-bearing history, model/TTS filtering, and Claude OAuth `tool_choice` requests.
- **Routing and infrastructure**: Corrected image/STT model tests, MiniMax reasoning follow-ups, Antigravity autocomplete, provider connection guards, tunnel interface detection, and configurable proxy uploads up to 128 MB.

## v0.4.43 (2026-06-05)

### Fixes

- **MITM Antigravity auth refresh**: Token refresh now uses the existing internal CLI token header to call the provider test route, keeping a single refresh path while avoiding `401 Unauthorized` from dashboard auth.
- **Auth refresh retries**: Token-swap auth refresh failures now retry up to 3 times before falling back to cooldown and next-account selection.
- **Refresh diagnostics**: Refresh attempts now log token lifetime in local time and surface the underlying refresh failure details instead of giving a generic failure.

### Improvements

- **Token swap visibility**: Dashboard token pool cards now show cooldown timing next to the active badge for accounts under cooldown.

### Tests

- Added coverage for Antigravity internal refresh calls, auth refresh failure logging, and retry behavior.

## v0.4.42 (2026-06-03)

### Fixes

- **OAuth token refresh reliability**: MITM token-pool refresh now handles connections with a refresh token but no `expiresAt`, and forced auth refreshes bypass still-valid expiry timestamps.
- **Connection test refresh flow**: Provider connection tests can now request a forced refresh and report whether new tokens were applied.
- **Token Rotation account toggles**: Toggling a pool account active/inactive no longer refetches quota data for every account.

### Tests

- Added token-pool coverage for missing-expiry refreshes and forced refresh requests.

## v0.4.41 (2026-06-03)

### Improvements

- **Token-swap toggle behavior**: Token swap now follows the global `tokenSwapEnabled` setting without requiring currently active provider connections.

### Fixes

- **Manual update command**: Corrected the dashboard update instructions to restart with `n9router` instead of `9router`.

### Tests

- Updated token-pool coverage for the global token-swap toggle behavior.

## v0.4.40 (2026-06-02)

### Fixes

- **MITM token swap retries on upstream 500s**: Antigravity token-swap requests now treat HTTP 500 as retryable instead of logging the response as a success, so the pool can move on to the next account after retry exhaustion.

## v0.4.39 (2026-05-30)

### Features

- **Stream Watchdog toggle**: New `streamWatchdogEnabled` setting (default ON) to opt out of SSE stall detection. When OFF, reverts to v0.4.35 legacy streaming (no stall abort, no `[DONE]`-on-abort sentinel, no Kiro keepalive). Addresses reasoning model regressions where Kiro claude-opus-4.8-thinking pauses mid-stream during server-side reasoning and was being killed by the 30s stall watchdog. Toggle available in dashboard Profile settings.

## v0.4.38 (2026-05-30)

### Fixes

- **Streaming requests no longer hang or return truncated results**: Fixed three issues in the SSE path that caused completions (notably Kiro `claude-opus-4.8` with thinking) to never finish.
  - **Kiro stall false-trigger**: The watchdog measured Kiro's transformed output instead of raw upstream activity, so reasoning prefill looked like a stall and aborted healthy streams. Kiro's transform now emits a keepalive on raw-byte activity.
  - **Truncated streams hung clients**: On abort/stall/reset the transform's `flush()` is skipped, so terminal `data: [DONE]` was never sent. `createDisconnectAwareStream` now emits it before closing (guarded against double-emit on graceful EOF).
  - **Kiro connect hang**: `KiroExecutor.execute` skipped `FETCH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`; a connection that never returned headers hung indefinitely. It now applies the same connect timeout as `base.js`.

### Tests

- Added `tests/unit/streamHandler.test.js` covering the terminal-sentinel safety net (abort/stall/reset injection, no double-emit on EOF, passthrough).

## v0.4.37 (2026-05-30)

### Fixes

- **DATA_DIR permissions**: Entrypoint script now dynamically sets permissions for custom `DATA_DIR` paths so non-default storage locations work in Docker.
- **API key rate-limit UI**: Restored the rate-limit controls in the endpoint settings (`EndpointPageClient.js`) that were orphaned during the upstream 0.4.66 merge.

### Improvements

- **Docker workflow**: Simplified the publish workflow by removing GHCR support and updating the image tagging strategy.

## v0.4.36 (2026-05-29)

### Features

- **Support "Today" period in usage statistics**: Enhanced report query logic in `usageDb.js` to handle local today timezone bucketing and hourly granularity from midnight.
- **OIDC Dashboard Authentication**: Integrated support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flows (`/api/auth/oidc/*` endpoints) to secure/standardize dashboard access.
- **Cowork MCP Marketplace integration**: Exposes local MCP plugins bridge (`/api/mcp/*` endpoints) and marketplace modal matching upstream Cowork directory.
- **Enhanced tunnel subsystem**: Restructured the cloudflared and tailscale tunnel modules into clean subdirectories (`src/lib/tunnel/cloudflare`, `src/lib/tunnel/tailscale`).
- **Proxy Pool Deployment Tools**: Added proxy deployment support for Cloudflare Workers and Deno Deploy (`/api/proxy-pools/cloudflare-deploy`, `/api/proxy-pools/deno-deploy`).
- **One-by-One Connection Validation**: Enhanced provider key/credential validation with one-by-one verification.
- **Provider OAuth Service**: Added authentication/token refresh services for xAI and Codex.

### Improvements

- **Merge upstream 9router v0.4.66**: Adopted CLI tool card refactoring (`ApiKeySelect`/`BaseUrlSelect`), provider searching, bulk key pasting, and new provider/model metadata, while rejecting the SQLite state database migration (keeping the fork's local lowdb `db.json` structure).
- **Provider Connection sorting**: Default connection listing to sort by provider name, then sub-sort by name/email.
- **Unit test coverage expansion**: Added robust testing for reasoning injectors, minimax TTS/usage, qoder encoding, OIDC auth, and today's usage statistics.

### Features

- Add Xiaomi MiMo provider support with built-in model metadata, validation endpoint, and provider icon
- Add Caveman prompt injection controls in the RTK request path, applied just before provider dispatch
- Add sticky round-robin support for combo routing so each combo model can receive multiple requests before rotating

- Add API key setup URLs across provider cards and improve responsive dashboard layouts for CLI tools, providers, usage, profile, and endpoint pages
- Add cached-token usage metrics and richer provider limit/topology displays in the usage dashboard

### Fixes

- Strip unsupported Anthropic `output_config` for MiniMax Claude-compatible requests while preserving it for Anthropic
- Merge Antigravity tool declaration groups into a single Gemini-compatible group before token-swap dispatch

## v0.4.23 (2026-05-02)

### Fixes

- Treat Antigravity MITM token-swap `403` IAM permission errors as retryable account fallback events, matching the existing `429`/`503` retry path

## v0.4.21 (2026-04-30)

### Features

- Add Antigravity host rewrite setting to avoid rate limits — toggle in Profile settings rewrites upstream host on each request

### Improvements

- Centralize MITM settings into a dedicated `mitmSettings.js` module for cleaner settings management
- Refactor `MitmToolCard` with a `DnsToggleButton` sub-component, improved DNS toggle UI, and abort signal support in fetch logic
- Refactor Antigravity logging to use consistent terminology and clear forced passthrough model list

### Fixes

- Rewrite Antigravity MITM handler to use direct `fetchRouter`/`pipeSSE` pipeline with proper SSE and non-SSE error responses — prevents SDK from hanging when an error occurs mid-stream

## v0.4.20 (2026-04-29)

### Features

- Add Antigravity MITM token-swap IDE version override with Profile settings toggle and configurable version, defaulting to `1.23.2`

### Improvements

- Rewrite both Antigravity request `metadata.ideVersion` and `user-agent` version when the override is enabled
- Route `/v1internal:loadCodeAssist` through Antigravity MITM token swap so eligibility-check requests can use the override
- Add a Profile settings notice that IDE version spoofing is used at your own risk

## v0.4.16 (2026-04-24)

### Features

- Add hourly `db.json` backups with 3-day retention and a Profile settings toggle enabled by default

### Fixes

- Prevent token-swap DB writes from racing normal local DB writes by using shared locking and atomic JSON updates
- Stop resetting `db.json` to defaults on corrupt JSON; restore from a valid backup or preserve the corrupt file for recovery

## v0.4.15 (2026-04-24)

## v0.4.14 (2026-04-23)

### Features

- Integrate RTK (Token Killer) compression into the MITM token-swap path — large tool outputs (git-diff, grep, ls, etc.) are now compressed before forwarding to upstream providers, reducing token usage by ~7% on real workloads

## v0.4.12 (2026-04-23)

### Features

- Add RTK — filter context (ls/grep/find/...) before sending to LLM to save tokens
- Add OpenCode Go provider and support for custom models
- Add Text To Image provider
- Support custom host URL for remote Ollama servers

### Fixes

- Fix copy to clipboard issue

## v0.4.11 (2026-04-23)

### Features

- Add per-account request health monitor in MITM Token Swap dashboard — last 100 calls displayed as colored 6×6px squares (green = success, orange gradient = retry success, red = fail) with live summary counts and hover tooltips
- Persist health history to `~/.n9router/account-health.json`; survives server restarts; polled every 10s in the dashboard

### Improvements

- Treat Antigravity 429 and 503 errors identically — both now retry the same account with exponential backoff (shared `_quotaRetryCount` counter, reuses per-account retry count setting)
- Apply cooldown/strike only after **2 consecutive fail** health events; a single 429/503 burst skips the account without penalising it, reducing false-positive cooldowns from Antigravity's random error responses
