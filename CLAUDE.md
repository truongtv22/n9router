# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

9Router is a self-hosted AI routing gateway built on Next.js 16 + React 19. It acts as a local proxy between AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) and 40+ upstream AI providers. It provides format translation (OpenAI <-> Claude <-> Gemini <-> etc.), multi-account fallback, quota tracking, and usage monitoring. The app exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `/v1/*` and a web dashboard at `/dashboard`.

## Architecture

### Two-Layer Routing Core

The system has a split routing architecture:

- **`src/sse/`** — App-level SSE handlers. Entry point is `src/sse/handlers/chat.js`. Handles model/combo resolution, credential selection, and delegates to the core.
- **`open-sse/`** — Shared, provider-agnostic routing engine (publishable as a separate package). Contains the core chat orchestration (`handlers/chatCore.js`), provider executors, format translators, and stream utilities.

Request flow: `API route → src/sse/handlers/chat.js → open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js → executor → upstream provider → response translator → client`

### Request Pipeline (`open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js`)

`handleChatCore` is the heart of the system; stage order matters and is easy to get wrong:

1. **Detect source format** from body shape (`detectFormat`); resolve `targetFormat` from provider/model.
2. **Bypass check** (`handleBypassRequest`) — warmup pings, title-generation, and skip patterns short-circuit before any upstream call.
3. **Translate OR passthrough** (see below).
4. **RTK compression** (`compressMessages`) + **Caveman** injection run on the *final translated body, just before dispatch* — not on the inbound request. They operate on `finalFormat` (= `sourceFormat` when passthrough, else `targetFormat`).
5. **Track pending** (`trackPendingRequest(...true)`) + log `PENDING`, then `executor.execute`.
6. **401/403 → token refresh → single retry**; non-ok upstream → error result.
7. Dispatch to the streaming / non-streaming / forced-SSE-to-JSON handler.

### Native Passthrough

When the detected client tool and upstream provider share an ecosystem (`isNativePassthrough`, e.g. Claude Code → a Claude-format provider), translation is skipped entirely — only `model` and the Bearer token are swapped. Lossless, avoids translation artifacts. RTK, caveman, and streaming still apply.

### RTK Token Saver (`open-sse/rtk/`)

Auto-detects tool-output `tool_result` blocks (git diff, grep, ls, tree, logs…) and applies lossless compression filters (`rtk/filters/`, dispatched via `applyFilter.js` + `autodetect.js`). Fail-safe: if a filter throws or grows the output, the original text is kept. Toggled per-request via the `rtkEnabled` flag threaded through `handleChatCore`.

### SSE Streaming Lifecycle (`open-sse/utils/stream.js`, `streamHandler.js`)

Streaming has subtle invariants worth understanding before touching it:

- `createStreamController` owns the upstream `AbortController` and the `connected` flag; its `handleComplete`/`handleError`/`handleDisconnect` are mutually-exclusive terminal states (first one wins).
- `pipeWithDisconnect` wires `upstreamResponse.body → upstreamTap (stall watchdog) → SSE transform → createDisconnectAwareStream → client`. The stall watchdog (`STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS=30s`) aborts if no bytes arrive; toggled via `streamWatchdogEnabled` setting (default ON). When OFF, reverts to v0.4.35 legacy streaming: no stall abort, no `[DONE]`-on-abort sentinel, no Kiro keepalive — stream pipes upstream→client until natural EOF. Reasoning models (Kiro claude-opus-4.8-thinking) pause mid-stream during server-side reasoning and were killed by the watchdog; OFF lets users opt out.
- The SSE transform's `flush()` is where `trackPendingRequest(...false)`, usage logging, `onStreamComplete`, and the terminal `data: [DONE]` happen. **`flush()` only runs on graceful EOF — never on abort/error.** Any abort/stall path must therefore handle pending-clear (via the controller's `onError`) and emit `[DONE]` itself, or clients hang on a truncated stream.
- `usageDb.js` has a `PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS` safety net that force-clears leaked pending counts — a backstop, not the primary cleanup path.
- Provider executors that override `execute()` (e.g. `kiro.js`) must replicate `base.js`'s `FETCH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` themselves, or a stalled connect hangs the whole request.

### Path Aliases

Defined in `jsconfig.json`:
- `@/*` → `./src/*`
- `open-sse` / `open-sse/*` → `./open-sse/*`

### API Routes (`src/app/api/`)

Two categories of API routes:

1. **Compatibility APIs** (consumed by CLI tools):
   - `/v1/chat/completions` — OpenAI-format chat (main entry point)
   - `/v1/messages` — Anthropic Claude format
   - `/v1/responses` — OpenAI Responses API format
   - `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`, `/v1beta/models`
   - URL rewrites in `next.config.mjs` map `/v1/*` → `/api/v1/*`

2. **Management APIs** (consumed by the dashboard):
   - `/api/providers*`, `/api/provider-nodes*` — provider CRUD
   - `/api/oauth/*` — OAuth flows for provider connections
   - `/api/keys*`, `/api/combos*`, `/api/models/alias` — API keys, model combos, aliases
   - `/api/settings/*`, `/api/auth/*`, `/api/usage/*`, `/api/sync/*`

### Format Translation System (`open-sse/translator/`)

Translates between provider-specific formats. Source format is auto-detected from the request endpoint and body shape (see `formats.js`). Supported formats: `openai`, `openai-responses`, `claude`, `gemini`, `vertex`, `codex`, `antigravity`, `kiro`, `cursor`, `ollama`.

- `translator/request/` — Inbound translation (e.g., `openai-to-claude.js`)
- `translator/response/` — Outbound translation (e.g., `claude-to-openai.js`)

### Provider Executors (`open-sse/executors/`)

Each executor handles a specific provider's auth, API endpoint construction, and credential refresh. Examples: `codex.js`, `cursor.js`, `gemini-cli.js`, `kiro.js`, `iflow.js`, `antigravity.js`, `vertex.js`. The `default.js` executor handles standard OpenAI-compatible providers.

### Combo + Account Fallback

- **Combos**: Named sequences of models tried in order (e.g., subscription → cheap → free)
- **Account fallback**: Multiple accounts per provider, round-robin with cooldown on failure
- Logic in `open-sse/services/accountFallback.js` and `src/sse/handlers/chat.js` (combo orchestration)

### Persistence

- **State DB**: `src/lib/localDb.js` → `${DATA_DIR}/db.json` (or `~/.n9router/db.json`). Uses lowdb. Stores provider connections, nodes, aliases, combos, API keys, settings, pricing.
- **Usage DB**: `src/lib/usageDb.js` → `~/.n9router/usage.json` + `~/.n9router/log.txt`. Independent from `DATA_DIR`.

### Frontend

- Next.js App Router with dashboard pages under `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/`
- Zustand stores in `src/store/` (providerStore, userStore, themeStore, notificationStore)
- UI components in `src/shared/components/`
- Tailwind CSS v4 via PostCSS plugin

### MITM Proxy (`src/mitm/`)

Separate child process for intercepting HTTPS traffic from CLI tools. Has its own cert generation (`cert/`), DNS handling, and Express server.

### Cloud Worker (`cloud/`)

Cloudflare Workers deployment for optional cloud sync relay. Has its own `wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, and separate source in `cloud/src/`.

## Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Required. Signs dashboard auth tokens |
| `INITIAL_PASSWORD` | Required. Dashboard login password |
| `DATA_DIR` | Persistent storage directory (default: `~/.n9router`) |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 20128) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public URL for the instance |
| `REQUIRE_API_KEY` | Enforce API key on `/v1/*` routes |
| `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGS` | Log full request/response bodies |

## Testing Notes

- Tests live in `tests/unit/` and use Vitest v4
- Vitest is installed in `/tmp/node_modules` to avoid conflicts with the root Next.js project's hoisting
- Test config is at `tests/vitest.config.js` — it aliases `open-sse` to the local package
- Coverage spans embeddings core, cloud worker handler, OAuth cursor auto-import, translation, provider validation, and the SSE stream handler (`unit/streamHandler.test.js`). Some pre-existing failures are unrelated to streaming — establish a baseline (e.g. `git stash` your changes and run once) before assuming a failure is yours.
- These tests use Web Streams directly: `createDisconnectAwareStream` locks the transform's writable internally, so drive a `ReadableStream` (deliver chunks across separate `pull()` calls, not synchronously in `start()`) rather than calling `getWriter()` yourself.

## CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
- Triggers on version tags (`v*`) and manual dispatch
- Builds and pushes Docker image to `ghcr.io`
- Docker uses multi-stage build with `node:20-alpine`, standalone Next.js output

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **n9router** (16261 symbols, 33897 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
